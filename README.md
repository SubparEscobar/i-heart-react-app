# i-heart-react
 
This project was created as an introduction to React, focusing on the fundamentals of components and props. It helped me learn how to build reusable UI elements and pass data between them using props.

## What I Learned
- How to create functional React components
- How to use props to pass data to components
- How to organize a React project structure
- The basics of rendering lists and dynamic content in React

## Project Structure
- `src/components/` contains all the custom React components used in the app
- `src/App.js` is the main entry point for the React application

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
	```bash
	cd i-heart-react-app/i-heart-react
	```
2. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	npm install
	```
3. Start the development server:
	```bash
	npm start
	```

## Why This Project Matters
This project was my first hands-on experience with React. It gave me a solid foundation in building user interfaces with components and props, which are the building blocks of any React application.
